        <p>I'm a student in the multidisciplinary Bachelor of Media Studies program at the University of British Columbia. 
            Currently, I create educational documentary videos on scientific topics for the Beaty Biodiversity Museum.
            In this role, I also collaborate with the exhibition and marketing teams to develop multimedia projects and generate content for social media.
            Previously, I trained as a post-production video editor at the Colorado Film School.</p>
